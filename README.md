META : Rotten Tomatoes Movies Rating Prediction Model 🍅
I have built a high-performing classification algorithm to predict whether a particular movie on Rotten Tomatoes is labeled as 'Rotten', 'Fresh', or 'Certified-Fresh', using two approaches :

First : By using numerical and categorical features powered Classification Models
Second : By using Text Data and Sentiment Analysis powered Classification Models (based on review data from critics)

- 🌲Model Two : Decision Tree Classifier Unconstrained
- 🌳Model Three : Random Forest Classifier
- 🧠Model Four : Random Forest Classifier with Feature Selection
- 🧠Model Five : Weighted Random Forest Classifier with Feature Selection

****SECOND APPROACH :** PREDICTING MOVIE STATUS BASED ON REVIEW TEXT SENTIMENT**
