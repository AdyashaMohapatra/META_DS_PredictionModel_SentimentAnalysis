META : Rotten Tomatoes Movies Rating Prediction Model
I have built a high-performing classification algorithm to predict whether a particular movie on Rotten Tomatoes is labeled as 'Rotten', 'Fresh', or 'Certified-Fresh', using two approaches :

First : By using numerical and categorical features powered Classification Models

Second : By using Text Data and Sentiment Analysis powered Classification Models (based on review data from critics)

FIRST APPROACH : PREDICTING MOVIE STATUS BASED ON NUMERICAL AND CATEGORICAL FEATURES

Data Preprocessing
Model One : Decision Tree Classifier Constrained to Three Leaf Nodes
Model Two : Decision Tree Classifier Unconstrained
Model Three : Random Forest Classifier
Model Four : Random Forest Classifier with Feature Selection
Model Five : Weighted Random Forest Classifier with Feature Selection
SECOND APPROACH : PREDICTING MOVIE STATUS BASED ON REVIEW TEXT SENTIMENT

Model Six : Default Random Forest
Model Seven : Weighted Random Forest
